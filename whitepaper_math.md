# White Paper — Mathematics Proof Audit Engine

## Abstract
Mathematics requires rigorous reproducibility of proofs. Current LLMs fail to produce consistent formal reasoning. The Zoran aSiM Mathematics Proof Audit Engine introduces injectors that enforce reproducibility with formal methods (Sympy, Z3), property-based tests, and Trust Reports.

## Introduction
Proof reproducibility is critical in applied and theoretical mathematics. Zoran aSiM provides a one-shot engine capable of generating IMRaD-structured outputs with embedded audits.

## Methods
- Formal verification (Sympy, Z3)
- Mutation and property-based testing
- ΔM11.3 fractal memory for reasoning

## Results
Injectors generate proof audits with Trust Reports in JSON, PDF, LaTeX.

## Discussion
This engine raises the bar for mathematical reproducibility.

## Conclusion
The Mathematics Proof Audit Engine provides a new reproducibility standard for computational mathematics.
