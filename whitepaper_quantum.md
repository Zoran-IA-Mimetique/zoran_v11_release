# White Paper — Quantum & Astrophysics Fractal Reasoning Engine

## Abstract
Quantum and astrophysical models are complex and difficult to reproduce. This engine applies fractal reasoning and numerical stability audits.

## Introduction
Quantum simulations and astrophysics require reproducibility and audit.

## Methods
- Formal verification (Sympy, Z3)
- Stability checks
- ΔM11.3 fractal reasoning

## Results
Injectors produce Trust Reports for quantum and astrophysical reproducibility.

## Conclusion
The Quantum & Astro Engine sets reproducibility benchmarks for frontier physics.
