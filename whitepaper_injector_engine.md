# White Paper — Zoran aSiM Injector-Engine (AllLabs)

## Abstract
The reproducibility crisis and the new compliance frameworks (GDPR, AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001) require stronger guarantees in research workflows. The Zoran aSiM Injector-Engine is a polymorphic generator capable of producing specialized injectors for France’s major research institutes: INSERM, CEA, INRIA, INRAE, IRD. It ensures reproducibility, auditability, and compliance in a one-shot exhaustive manner.

## Introduction
Scientific reproducibility has become a global concern. The Injector-Engine addresses this by providing auto-generated injectors tailored to specific labs and domains, embedding reproducibility checks, anonymization, compliance validation, and generating Trust Reports in multiple formats.

## Methods
- GlyphNet engine block with polymorphic mappings
- YAML templates auto-generated for each institute/domain
- Plugins (imaging, genomics, ML robustness, HPC, agro-climate, epidemiology)
- Tests: property-based, mutation, chaos, formal verification
- Governance: ZDM, EthicChain, KeyGuardian signing

## Results
The engine generates injectors such as:
- INSERM imaging injector: anonymization + stability + property checks
- INRIA ML injector: adversarial + mutation + reproducibility
- CEA HPC injector: numerical stability + formal verification
- INRAE agro injector: sensitivity analysis + trust reporting
- IRD epidemiology injector: anonymization + reproducibility audit

## Discussion
Injector-Engine demonstrates the feasibility of a unified approach across heterogeneous labs. It embeds compliance by design, reproducibility by structure, and auditability by instrumentation. This model can be extended to other institutions and international contexts.

## Conclusion
The Zoran aSiM Injector-Engine represents a foundation for reproducible and ethical science across large research networks.
