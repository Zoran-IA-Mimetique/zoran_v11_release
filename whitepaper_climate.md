# White Paper — Climate & HPC Multi-Scale Simulation Engine

## Abstract
Climate models and HPC simulations face reproducibility gaps. The Climate & HPC Engine enforces reproducibility through chaos testing, sensitivity analysis, and Trust Reports.

## Introduction
Climate projections inform global policies. Reproducibility and auditability are critical.

## Methods
- Chaos testing
- Sensitivity analysis on temperature, rainfall, CO2
- ΔM11.3 reasoning

## Results
Injectors generate reproducible multi-scale simulations with signed Trust Reports.

## Discussion
Provides reproducibility assurance for climate science.

## Conclusion
The Climate & HPC Engine aligns HPC with compliance and reproducibility.
